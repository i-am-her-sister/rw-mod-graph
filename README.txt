This is a connectivity diagram of modded and official regions in Rain World for version 1.9. Calling it a map would be a stretch.

How to use:

The graph represents a schematic of connections between modded and official regions in the game Rain World. 
The nodes are the regions themselves, labeled with their acronyms, and hovering over them will reveal their full names. 
Edges (lines connecting two regions) indicate that there is a gate between those two regions (one-way gates are not specifically marked!). 
You can select the set of represented regions and the state of the world on the side panel, drag nodes using the mouse. 
The “Restart Simulation” button allows you to position the nodes at a certain distance from each other.
Buttons with group names allow you to turn on or off all regions within a group simultaneously.

I made this almost without any programming knowledge, just by using AI and common sense. 
Therefore, my code is a complete mess, filled with duplicate or non-functional fragments and strange decisions. 
I mostly did it for fun, and I'm not sure how useful it really is. 
For information sources, I used the Rain World Mods Wiki, my own knowledge, and Alduris' mod map.
